# Using Kops

If you are setting up a cluster using kops, then run the script located at https://github.com/BlockClusterApp/configs/blob/d7673425c6f2c781338a9c5c0dff16377c364c7e/kops/setup-cluster.sh.

In between the script, you would be required to add DNS records to your domain hosting provider. The required NS records will be generated by the script.

P.S. The script is not re-run proof with the same arguments. If anything breaks in between, you would have to edit the script and comment code accordingly.
